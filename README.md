# My Machine Learning Journey!

Hi everyone! I'm currently taking Harvard's Data Science: Machine Learning course. I have some understanding of ML in Python and wanted to reinformce my learning and application of ML. This repo is my personal journal documenting what I've learned, some challenges, and future applications.
