# Week 1: Categorical Data and Linear Regression

## What I've Learned
- RStudios Interface:
    Prior to starting the course, I self-taught how to navigate the interface of RStudios via youtube videos. There are four main sections: the top left corner has the R scripts; the bottom left contains the console, terminal, and background jobs; top right tracks the all the activity in the environment, history, and connections and tutorials; and lastly the bottom left displays graphys produced in the R script, files, loaded packages, and help.
- R Language and Syntax:
    [1] The equal sign in R is "<-". [2] Writing a function in R is very similar to Python and Java, however, pipe operators "%>%" are a very new concept to me. An opporator allows for multiple functions to be chained together, resulting in one output. For instance, instead of nesting functions like in Python, in R the functions x, y, and z can be truncated to "output <- x %>% y %>% z". [3] If else statements can be written in one line. For example in the code "fruit <- ifelse(number > 5, "orange", "apple")", if the variable "number" is greater than 5, the fruit is orange, else it is an apple.
